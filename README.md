Our goal is simple: Find My Trash (FMT) aims to identify and help clean up the polluted areas in the region. Our website focuses on reducing the waste in Bangalore with the help of our volunteers. 

FMT needs only one thing from you: to input your location. 
The site will then take it from there. It will identify the polluted locations in your area and send in the crews to help clean it up. 

Making Bangalore environmentally friendly begins with you!
